[h1] Description [/h1]
This is the LaserSTool I've originally ported to GM13 since then I am constantly
improving it. My goal is making it behave as similar to a real laser beam.
The original creator is MadJawa, and his repository is located here. I cannot
tell you that the original author will still supports this repo in the future,
but we can clearly see no commits are made since 2009.

[h1]About workshop[/h1]
I see many copies of this tool everywhere, but still, there is none that
have crated official repository for community contribution, besides, I think
the original author will not like that in general. If you want to try the tool
Go ahead and install it. If the original author asks I will take this down!

Reuploading and source stealing will not be tolerated!
Selling it is also out of option, as the open source suggests!
